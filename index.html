    <h2>⏳ The Hackathon Journey</h2>
    <p>The <strong>36-hour hackathon</strong> was intense, to say the least. It was a mix of sleepless nights, rapid prototyping, and pushing ourselves to the limits. But in the end, we nailed it!</p>
    <p>And when it was time to present, our hearts were racing. But we knew we had something special to show the jury. 💪</p>

    <h2>🔥 The Comeback Story</h2>
    <p>What makes this win even more special is the fact that last year, in <strong>2023</strong>, we were <strong>Runner-Up</strong>. That experience pushed us harder, and we came back with a fire to win this year!</p>
