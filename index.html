  <section id="intro">
    <p>I can't even begin to express how excited I am to share this news – <strong>Smart Smurfs 561</strong> won the <strong>Smart India Hackathon 2024</strong>! 🏅</p>
    <p>We took on the challenge of <strong>Voice-Controlled Gaming Tools for Enhanced Learning in the Skill Ecosystem (PS ID: 1779)</strong> under the <strong>Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)</strong> in the <strong>Toys & Games</strong> category.</p>
    <p>The hackathon went down from <strong>December 11-12, 2024</strong> at <strong>G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur</strong>, and honestly, it was an experience I’ll never forget!</p>

    <h2>📸 Here's a Sneak Peek of the Journey</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into what we built, let me show you a couple of fun moments from the event. You know, the ones where we actually look like we know what we're doing 😜.</p>

  <section id="project">
    <h2>💡 What We Built</h2>
    <p>Our solution? We created <strong>Virtual Reality healthcare training</strong> modules in <strong>Unity</strong>. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPR Training:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Chest compressions</li>
          <li>AED usage</li>
          <li>Oxygen mask handling</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Surgical Training:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Suturing</li>
          <li>Bandaging</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>But wait, there's more! We also built <strong>Medibot</strong>, an AI assistant that uses <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> to help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluate your skills</li>
      <li>Aid in decision-making</li>
      <li>Generate performance reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And then, we topped it off with a <strong>Dashboard</strong> for all your live data needs, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Live streaming</strong></li>
      <li><strong>ECG wave analysis (PQRST)</strong></li>
      <li>Health metrics like <strong>respiration rate, pulse, SpO₂</strong>, and system performance insights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was all aimed at delivering <strong>VR-based healthcare training</strong> that’s immersive and interactive!</p>

    <h2>⏳ The Hackathon Journey</h2>
    <p>The <strong>36-hour hackathon</strong> was intense, to say the least. It was a mix of sleepless nights, rapid prototyping, and pushing ourselves to the limits. But in the end, we nailed it!</p>
    <p>And when it was time to present, our hearts were racing. But we knew we had something special to show the jury. 💪</p>

    <h2>🔥 The Comeback Story</h2>
    <p>What makes this win even more special is the fact that last year, in <strong>2023</strong>, we were <strong>Runner-Up</strong>. That experience pushed us harder, and we came back with a fire to win this year!</p>
    <p>And here we are, standing at the top! 🌟</p>
