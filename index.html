    🎉 WE WON the Smart India Hackathon 2024! 🏆
  </header>

  <section id="intro" class="light-animation">
    <p>Let me just start by saying, <strong>we did it</strong>! After hours of caffeine, coding, and pretending to understand what we were doing, <strong>Smart Smurfs 561</strong> emerged victorious at the <strong>Smart India Hackathon 2024</strong>! 🏅</p>
    <p>We took on the challenge of creating <strong>Voice-Controlled Gaming Tools for Enhanced Learning in the Skill Ecosystem (PS ID: 1779)</strong> for the <strong>Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)</strong>. Fancy, right? All in the <strong>Toys & Games</strong> category, because nothing says "high-stakes" like games.</p>
    <p>Let me set the scene: it was December 11-12, 2024, at the <strong>G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur</strong>. Imagine a room full of sleep-deprived hackers trying to figure out how to make AI play well with voice commands. I don’t know about you, but it felt like a <strong>reality TV show</strong> with zero sleep and way too many energy drinks.</p>

    <h2>📸 Here's a Sneak Peek of the Journey</h2>
    <p>Okay, before I dive into the techy stuff (you know, the part that actually got us the win), let me share some snapshots from the event. These are the rare moments where we looked like we were experts and not just looking for a place to nap.</p>

  <section id="project" class="light-animation">
    <h2>💡 What We Built</h2>
    <p>Okay, time for the cool stuff. So, what did we actually create? Well, we got a bit ambitious and built a <strong>Virtual Reality healthcare training</strong> system. Sounds fancy, huh? Here’s the breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPR Training:</strong> Because who wouldn’t want to save a life in VR? Chest compressions, AED usage, oxygen mask handling... all in one package!</li>
      <li><strong>Surgical Training:</strong> For when you want to feel like a doctor but without the years of med school. Suturing, bandaging, the works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But wait, we didn’t stop there. We also made a <strong>Medibot</strong>, an AI assistant that’s like your personal health coach... if your health coach had a PhD in Machine Learning. It helps you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluate your skills</li>
      <li>Aid in decision-making</li>
      <li>Generate performance reports (because we all love stats)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We topped it off with a <strong>Dashboard</strong> to make everything look official, featuring live data, ECG wave analysis, and health metrics. It’s like a real-time doctor’s office, but with less judgment.</p>

    <h2>⏳ The Hackathon Journey</h2>
    <p>Let me tell you, the hackathon wasn’t just about code. It was about survival. 36 hours of non-stop pressure, and by pressure, I mean figuring out how to make everything work at the very last minute. But somehow, we pulled through. Sleepless nights, endless snacks, and too many 'what was I thinking?' moments later, we had our presentation ready.</p>
    <p>When it came time to present, my heart was doing the Macarena, but we were ready. We knew we had built something that could actually make a difference. 💪</p>

  <section id="comeback" class="light-animation">
    <h2>🔥 The Comeback Story</h2>
    <p>What makes this win even sweeter? We were <strong>Runner-Up</strong> last year. Yeah, we didn’t win, but we learned a lot and came back this year with a vengeance. It was like the <strong>Rocky</strong> movie, but with more code and less boxing.</p>
    <p>And here we are, standing at the top. But don’t worry, we’ll keep our feet on the ground... until the next hackathon. 😜</p>

  <section id="thankyou" class="light-animation">
    <h2>🙏 A Big Thank You</h2>
    <p>First, let’s give a huge shoutout to our fearless leader, <strong>Harini V</strong>. Without you, we would’ve probably just built a VR game about coffee breaks. Seriously, your leadership was the secret ingredient to this success.</p>
    <p>Big thanks to my incredible teammates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@Bramarambika</li>
      <li>@KrithikRaghav</li>
      <li>@Mohamed Suhail</li>
      <li>@Ratnesh (that’s me!) 😎</li>
      <li>@Sakthisree</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And, of course, our mentors, who were like the GPS guiding us through this hackathon maze.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to <strong>G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur</strong> for making everything smooth—except for the Wi-Fi, which was a little too smooth. 😂</p>

  <section id="future" class="light-animation">
    <h2>🚀 Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>And just like that, we’re onto the next big thing. This win? Just the beginning! Our next project is already brewing in the lab. Stay tuned for more awesome stuff coming your way.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>And trust me, we’ve got a ton of dreams. The only thing standing between us and success is... well, sleep. But we’ll get there.</p>
