# 🎉 **WE WON the Smart India Hackathon 2024!** 🏆

I can't even begin to express how excited I am to share this news – **Smart Smurfs 561** won the **Smart India Hackathon 2024**! 🏅

We took on the challenge of **Voice-Controlled Gaming Tools for Enhanced Learning in the Skill Ecosystem (PS ID: 1779)** under the **Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)** in the **Toys & Games** category.

The hackathon went down from **December 11-12, 2024** at **G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur**, and honestly, it was an experience I’ll never forget!

## 📸 Here's a Sneak Peek of the Journey

Before we dive into what we built, let me show you a couple of fun moments from the event. You know, the ones where we actually look like we know what we're doing 😜.

## 💡 **What We Built**

Our solution? We created **Virtual Reality healthcare training** modules in **Unity**. Here’s a breakdown:

- **CPR Training**:
  - Chest compressions
  - AED usage
  - Oxygen mask handling
- **Surgical Training**:
  - Suturing
  - Bandaging

But wait, there's more! We also built **Medibot**, an AI assistant that uses **Machine Learning** and **Python** to help:

- Evaluate your skills
- Aid in decision-making
- Generate performance reports

And then, we topped it off with a **Dashboard** for all your live data needs, like:

- **Live streaming**
- **ECG wave analysis (PQRST)**
- Health metrics like **respiration rate, pulse, SpO₂**, and system performance insights.

This was all aimed at delivering **VR-based healthcare training** that’s immersive and interactive!

## ⏳ **The Hackathon Journey**

The **36-hour hackathon** was intense, to say the least. It was a mix of sleepless nights, rapid prototyping, and pushing ourselves to the limits. But in the end, we nailed it!

And when it was time to present, our hearts were racing. But we knew we had something special to show the jury. 💪

## 🔥 **The Comeback Story**

What makes this win even more special is the fact that last year, in **2023**, we were **Runner-Up**. That experience pushed us harder, and we came back with a fire to win this year! 

And here we are, standing at the top! 🌟
