# 🎉 **WE WON the Smart India Hackathon 2024!** 🏆

I'm beyond excited to share that our team, **Smart Smurfs 561**, has **won** the **Smart India Hackathon 2024**! 🏅

We took on the challenge of **Voice-Controlled Gaming Tools for Enhanced Learning in the Skill Ecosystem (PS ID: 1779)** under the **Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)** in the **Toys & Games** category. 

The hackathon took place from **December 11-12, 2024** at **G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur**, and it was absolutely unforgettable!

## 💡 **What We Built**

Our solution was all about **Virtual Reality healthcare training** in **Unity**. We created modules for:

- **CPR Training**:
  - Chest compressions
  - AED usage
  - Oxygen mask handling
- **Surgical Training**:
  - Suturing
  - Bandaging

Plus, we made **Medibot**, an AI assistant powered by **Machine Learning** and **Python** that helps:

- Assess user skills
- Aid decision-making
- Generate performance reports

And of course, there’s our super useful **Dashboard** with:

- **Live streaming**
- **ECG wave analysis (PQRST)**
- Health metrics like **respiration rate, pulse, SpO₂**, and performance insights.
